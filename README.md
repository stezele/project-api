#  Project-api

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Project API**, a system designed to manage and process employee hiring data efficiently using a **Medallion architecture** in **Azure SQ**L. The API supports batch data ingestion and querying transformed data for reporting in **Power BI**.

Features

Batch Data Ingestion: Supports inserting data into the Bronze layer in batches of 1 to 1000 rows.

Data Processing Pipeline: Transforms raw data from Bronze to Silver for analysis.

Power BI Integration: Queries transformed data from Silver to generate business insights.

Medallion Architecture: Implements a structured approach to data storage and transformation.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The API follows the Medallion architecture with three layers:

Bronze: Stores raw data. This is where new records are ingested.

Silver: Contains cleaned and transformed data. The API queries this layer for insights.

Gold: Provides aggregated and structured data views for reporting.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

FastAPI

SQLAlchemy

Azure SQL Database

Power BI for visualization
